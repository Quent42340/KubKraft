• TODO: Include server code in the client for singleplayer games

# Issues

• DONE: Crafting doesn’t always work
• DONE: A mix of pickaxe + axe recipes gives a pickaxe?!
• DONE: Lighting doesn’t propagate between chunks
• DONE: Pressing `Esc` key in `SettingsMenuState` should just quit the category, not the state
• DONE: Chunks are sent too many times to client on login

   ◦ TODO: `Workbench` and `Furnace` are not scaled correctly with lower GUI scale settings
      ◦ TODO: Send client screen size and GUI scale to server
• TODO: Blocks can be accessed from outside the world (will need a refactoring)
• TODO: Collisions are fucked up with blocks placed at `x = -1` from `x = 0`
• TODO: Blocks can be placed inside the player (check for AABB?)
• TODO: Sometimes it’s possible to aim between two blocks and right-clicking will replace one

# Code improvements

• DONE: Pass `ClientCommandHandler` instead of `Client` in the game (for example in `BlockCursor`)
   → DONE: This will allow to send network commands via a single function
   → DONE: The code won’t be replicated anymore
   → DONE: Packages musn’t be send from another place than `ClientCommandHandler`
• TODO: Use `ServerCommandHandler` instead of `Server` (cf. above)

# Refactorings

• DONE: In `SettingsMenuState`, the “Done” button shouldn’t be part of the `Menu`
• TODO: Remove the ability of `Chunk` and `ChunkLightmap` to access surrounding chunk blocks
• TODO: `Chunk::setBlock` does way too much things, fix this
• TODO: Add a mesh system, either here or in `GameKit`
   → Maybe this is the way to add custom vertex attributes while having default ones? Check 3dee
   → Or maybe it would be better to use a VAO in `GameKit`
